# Python T1W6 Saturday Class

# If-Else Practice Activity

## Building a calculator
Building a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 Inputs as numbers(floats) for operation and 3rd to decide which operation they want to use.

# Lists
Composite Data Type, meaning multiple dat types can be stored in one variable. Each place is called an element.

# Loops
Like Post Malone describes, "Run away, but we're running in circles".
Used a repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

DRY Coding Principles

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank

"if" condition would decide whether or not to run the intended block. Whereas, Loops would decide how many times the user wants to run the intended block.

# While Loop
While the condition is met, keep executing the intended block. If not met, it will skip block.

Things to remember:
-  Program can enter the loop
- Program and exit the loop

# Range
It's a pre-defined function that generates a sequence of numbers.

Useful: Loops for iterating a specific number of times over a sequence of numbers.

Range(start, stop, step)
Range(5)

# For Loop
For each item in a sequence, execute the intended sequence.

for variable_name in sequence:
    start

## Practice Example 1
Finding the sum of the first ten numbers (1, 2, ... 10)
