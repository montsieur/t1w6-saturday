## Building a calculator
Building a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 Inputs as numbers(floats) for operation and 3rd to decide which operation they want to use.

Composite Data Type, meaning multiple dat types can be stored in one variable. Each place is called an element.

# Loops
Like Post Malone describes, "Run away, but we're running in circles".
Used a repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.
